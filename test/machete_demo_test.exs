  # 
  # RUNNING THIS DEMO
  #
  # The Machete demo is structured as a series of failing tests. You are expected to make each of
  # them pass one by one by following the hints given for each. 
  #
  # All of the tests except the first are skipped by default; as you work through the tests and
  # make them pass, remove the `@tag: :skip` line the following test to keep making progress!
  #
  # Each test has an overview and some hints to help you on your way. Consult the [Machete
  # docs](https://hexdocs.pm/machete/Machete.html) for details about how to use Machete.
  #
  # Good luck!
